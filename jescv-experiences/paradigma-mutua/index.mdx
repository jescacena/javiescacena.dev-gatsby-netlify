### Contributions

We participate in the development of all types of claims reports.
I was also an advocate for introducing code quality through <strong>unit testing</strong>

### What i learned

It greatly improves my knowledge of <strong>AngularJS</strong>. We help implement a local
development environment that does not need to start the Eclipse environment
